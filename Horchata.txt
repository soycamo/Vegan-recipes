Horchata

  - 1 c long grain white rice
  - 1.5 c water
  - 2 sticks cinnamon
  - 1/3 cup sugar

Boil all in a saucepan until rice is overcooked, like a porridge. Let mixture
sit covered with cheesecloth overnight. Pour liquid into a bottle.

Notes
=====
Needs MORE cinnamon and I'll have to build a horchata press or something...
